## Introduction

Welcome to the magical realm of the **Image Classifier for Movie Characters**! As an avid potterhead, I've always wondered about the visual evolution of our beloved characters. This project is my journey into the world of supervised classification algorithms, aiming to unravel whether these algorithms can recognize our cherished characters' transformations throughout the years.

The project showcases the potency of classification machine learning algorithms, including SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. But the enchantment doesn't stop thereâ€”Flask is harnessed to connect these algorithms to a captivating user interface.
